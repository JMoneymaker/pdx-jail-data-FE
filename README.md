# PDX Jail Data
The PDX Jail Data Dashboard was created for public information purposes, compiling and visualising key population data for persons jailed in the Portland Metro Area. 

The data is sourced from the jail roster information pages of [Clackamas](https://web3.clackamas.us/roster/), [Multnomah](https://www.mcso.us/paid), and [Washington](https://www.co.washington.or.us/Sheriff/Jail/who-is-in-custody.cfm) counties, and updated each morning.
